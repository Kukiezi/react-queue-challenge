Create React application that:
- has 5 cashiers
- input that accepts the amount of groceries that the next person going to checkout is going to have
- when input is submitted assign the person to the cashier queue that has the least amount of groceries in the queue
- every 0.5 seconds the first person in each queue should have one grociery removed (processed) by cashier
- when count of groceries for the person reach 0, remove the person from the queue, and move the next one to the front


Everything should be animated, so the queue is a column to the cashier, when we remove the first person from the queue, the queue moved forward.

good luck!
